# Vote-Reporting-using-Python
Improvement Process - Small Municipality Vote Reporting 

The goal of this effort is to help a small town be able to update its reporting of its voting results.  The main source of voting data is an election_data csv file that contains Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

The requirements for reporting included capturing:
1. Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates receiving votes.
3. Percentage of votes each candiate won.
4. Total number of Votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on the popular vote.

The developed Python script has logic to open and write the results to an output txt file while also printing to the terminal display.  The repo project had analysis and resources folders, the scripts and outputs are in the analysis folders and input files are in the resources folders.
