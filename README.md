Python challenge repository

This repository consists of the two scripts to process the financial records (aka budget data) via the csv input file and the voting results for the election in the small town.  The voting input file was also csv format.
Each of the Python scripts has logic to open and write the results to an output txt file while also printing to the terminal display.
Each assignment had analysis and resources folders set up, the scripts and outputs are in the analysis folders and input files are in the resources folders.
